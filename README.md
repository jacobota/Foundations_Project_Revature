- HTTP Endpoints: Utilizing Express.js, the project establishes HTTP endpoints for communication between the frontend and backend.
- Unit Testing: Jest is employed for unit testing.
- HTTP Request Testing: Postman is utilized for testing HTTP requests, allowing for thorough validation of the API endpoints.

## Technologies

- JavaScript: The primary programming language for the backend development.
- Node.js: Powers the backend API development.
- Express.js: Used to build HTTP endpoints and handle routing within the application.
- Jest: A testing framework for unit testing JavaScript code.
- Postman: A powerful tool for testing and debugging HTTP requests.
